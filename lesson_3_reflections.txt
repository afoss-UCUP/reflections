When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you anticipate not always working from the same machine.  Also makes code robust to
hardware failures.  Finally, allows for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have other people contributing to the online repository and not want to deal
with conflicts until you make a final commit.
