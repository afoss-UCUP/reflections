When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you anticipate not always working from the same machine.  Also makes code robust to
hardware failures.  Finally, allows for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have other people contributing to the online repository and not want to deal
with conflicts until you make a final commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones of a repo on GitHub, used to get projects that others have been working on
which you do not have permission to modify. Clones completely copy a repo in very general terms.
Branches initiate a breakpoint to allow one to develop w/o upsetting things
in another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows for offline work and immediate re-syncing with GitHub by fetching or pulling and
using merge's conflict handling. It also allows for fast forward merging if the commits can
reach each other (easy to tell if recorded)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

You could collaborate by locking files when another checks them out.  Making simultaneous changes
would be tricky - but you wouldn't often have merge conflicts.
