How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff allowed me to see the specific line changes that had occured in the file, 
helping me hone in on the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow me to go back to working versions of a program (before a bug was introduced)
It would allow me to experiment without changing the entire codebase and revert if needed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually saving ensures that the breakpoints are meaningful to the person doint the saving

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It allows interdependencies to be recorded and ensures that the correct pieces of code stay together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows one to see the commit points where specific changes were made to a file
git diff allows changes between commit points to be viewed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know you can always change it back if you do!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Code control!
