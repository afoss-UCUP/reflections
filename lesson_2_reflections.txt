What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the appropriate metadata to begin tracking versions. Without
the metadata, Git won't know what to track. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Having a staging area allows you to seperate commits into logical units.
It also provides a space to think about the committ.
It differs from the repository (historic version) and the working
directory (live local version)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Git diff will allow one to review changes to ensure one change is being added at a time.
Files can be removed from staging with git reset

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in 
keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help anytime you were adding a feature you were uncertain about while continuing
work on the master.
Branches would also facilitate work across different people who could tackle different elements.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams allow one to see where code diverges, so changes made after junctures can be tracked.

What is the result of merging two branches together? 
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches leaves one main path, but earlier commits where the code was separated
can still be reached 

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Git's merge takes care of simple issues much faster!
