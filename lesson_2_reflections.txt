What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the appropriate metadata to begin tracking versions. Without
the metadata, Git won't know what to track. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Having a staging area allows you to seperate commits into logical units.
It also provides a space to think about the committ.
It differs from the repository (everything that is tracked) and the working
directory (whatever is the location of the repository)
